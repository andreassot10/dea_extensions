# dea_extensions

This is a collection of R functions for Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models that I have developed either for my publications or for further data exploration in the background.

## dea_gle()

Global efficiencies (GLE) model for ranking Decision-Making Units (DMUs) with a common set of input and output weights (Despotis, 2002).

### Arguments

| Argument  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| base          | A data frame with *n* rows and *s* + *m* columns, where *n* is the number of Decision-Making Units (DMUs), *s* is the number of outputs and *m* is the number of inputs.  |
| noutput       | Numeric. The number of outputs produced by the DMUs.  |
| eff           | A numeric vector of the efficiency scores.  |
| t_values      | A numeric vector of the values of *t* for which GLE should be run. Should be increasing incrementally from 0 to 1, e.g. by 0.01 or otherwise. Defaults to seq(0, 1, 0.01). |

### Details
The function calculates, for each DMU, the GLE scores and sets of intput and output weights for the different values of *t*, the average GLE score, as well the ranking factor for each DMU. In his original paper, Despotis (2002) proposes to consider the unique sets of weights when these are duplicated for different values of *t*. However, this does not work well in R, because seemingly identical sets of weights for different values of *t* are often not considered equal. Consider the classic example `sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2` which returns `FALSE`. So if, for example, in a single-input single-output case the set of weights was `c(2, 3)` for *t* = 0.02 and `c(sqrt(2) ^ 2, sqrt(3) ^ 2)` for *t* = 0.03, then `c(2, 3) == c(sqrt(2) ^ 2, sqrt(3) ^ 2)` would return `c(FALSE, FALSE)`. It is therefore much safer to average over *all* GLE scores rather than remove the duplicated ones.

### Value
A list with arguments `GLE` and `weights`.

Argument `GLE` is a data frame with *n* rows and 1 + `length(t_values)` + 1 + 1 + 1 columns with the DEA efficiency scores, the GLE scores for the different values of *t*, the average GLE score (AVGLE), variable *q* indicating the number of times a GLE score was equal to 1, and the ranking factor *q* + AVGLE.

Argument 'weights' is a data frame with `length(t_values)` rows and *s* + *m* columns, containing the sets of common weights for each value of *t*.
